# 🧠 High Performance Computing (HPC) Roadmap

Welcome to my **HPC Mastery Roadmap** — an open learning journey to master the art of **building, optimizing, and deploying high-performance computing systems**.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To gain deep expertise in:
- **Parallel Programming** (OpenMP, MPI)
- **GPU Computing** (CUDA, Numba, CuPy)
- **Cluster Architecture & Scheduling** (SLURM, PBS)
- **Cloud HPC** (AWS ParallelCluster, Kubernetes)
- **Performance Optimization** (profiling, scaling, hybrid parallelism)
